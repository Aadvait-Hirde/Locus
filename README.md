# Locus
Locus is an AR-based indoor navigation application built using Unity. It was built using the Unity Development Engine and was coded primarily in C#. The modules used for Android were AR Foundation and ARCore. After a scale model of the school was replicated in Unity, navigation targets were assigned to each class. After scanning the QR code, a line is rendered from the userâ€™s origin to the destination selected by them, thus enabling indoor pathfinding.
